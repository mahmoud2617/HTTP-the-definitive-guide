# HTTP: The Definitive Guide — Summary Notes

This is a personal summary of the book *HTTP: The Definitive Guide*.  
I created it to help myself when reviewing the material later, and to share it with anyone who might find it useful.

Some sections were too important to summarize, so I kept them as they are. Every part of the book matters, but I tried to focus on the most essential ideas and explanations.

All notes are written in **Obsidian**, so for the best experience, I recommend opening them there.  
Make sure to include each chapter’s **assets folder** along with its corresponding note file to see the images and diagrams properly.

I hope this helps someone as much as it helped me while studying.
